# FoundationPress [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/olefredrik/FoundationPress.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/olefredrik/FoundationPress)

This is a WordPress starter theme based on Foundation 5 by Zurb. The purpose of FoundationPress, is to act as a small and handy toolbox that contains the essentials needed to build any design. FoundationPress is meant to be a starting point, not the final product. If you're looking for an all-in-one theme with built-in shortcodes, plugins, fancypancy portfolio templates or whatnot, I'm afraid you have to look elsewhere.

Please fork, copy, modify, delete, share or do whatever you like with this.

All contributions are welcome!

## Requirements

**Please read this. It's totally worth it.**

FoundationPress uses [Sass](http://Sass-lang.com/) (CSS with superpowers). In short, Sass is a CSS pre-processor that allows you to write styles more effectively and tidy.

All the Sass (.scss) files are compiled into one single css file. To make this happen, we use a tool called Grunt; a task runner that automates repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, linting, etc.

**NOTE: You'll need to have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed before continuing.**

## Quickstart

### 1. Clone the repository and install dependencies with npm
```bash
$ cd my-wordpress-folder/wp-content/themes/
$ git clone git@github.com:olefredrik/FoundationPress.git
$ mv FoundationPress your-theme-name
$ cd your-theme-name

$ npm install
# bower install && grunt build will be called via npm scripts when you run npm install.
```

(Many project force their users to install [Bower](http://bower.io) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) globally. We don't like that and decided to use them via `npm scripts` which means, that Grunt and Bower are installed in your `node_modules` folder and we'll call them there.)



### 2. While you're working on your project, run:

```bash
$ npm run watch
```

### 3. For building all the assets, run:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

### 4. Compress all files required for deployment:
It is not recommended that you deploy the entire theme folder to your webserver. There is no danger associated with doing this, but it is a waste of disk space and bandwidth. The node_modules and components for instance is only required during theme development.

By executing the command below, you will compress only the files that are required for deployment. The file will be available as a .zip inside the folder named '/package'.

```bash
$ npm run package
```


### How to structure your styles

  * `style.css`: Do not worry about this file. (For some reason) it's required by WordPress. All styling are handled in the Sass files described below

  * `assets/scss/foundation.scss`: Imports for Foundation components and your custom styles.
  * `assets/scss/config/_settings.scss`: Original Foundation 5 base settings
  * `assets/scss/config/_custom-settings.scss`: Copy the settings you will modify to this file. Make it your own
  * `assets/scss/site/*.scss`: Unleash your creativity. Create the files you need (and remember to make import statements for all your files in assets/scss/foundation.scss)

Please note that you **must** run `$npm run build` in your terminal for the styles to be copied and concatinated. See [Gruntfile.js](https://github.com/olefredrik/FoundationPress/blob/master/Gruntfile.js) for details

### How to structure your scripts

* `assets/javascript/custom`: This is the folder where you put all your custom scripts. Every .js file you put in this directory will be minified and concatinated one single .js file. (This is good for site speed and performance)

Please note that you must run `npm run build` in your terminal for the scripts to be copied and concatinated. See [Gruntfile.js](https://github.com/olefredrik/FoundationPress/blob/master/Gruntfile.js) for details

### The styles and scripts generated by the build

Version control on these files are turned off because they are automatically generated as part of the build process.

* `assets/stylesheets/foundation.css`: All Sass files are minified and compiled to this file
* `assets/stylesheets/foundation.css.map`: CSS source maps

* `assets/javascript/vendor`: Vendor scripts are copied from `assets/javascript/components/` to this directory. We use this path for enqueing the vendor scripts in WordPress.
